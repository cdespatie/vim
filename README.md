# vim
Repo for my .vimrc

## Color themes:
Included. Install by moving files to `~/.vim/colors/`.

## Plugins:
Uses vim-plug for plugin management now, so plugin list is no longer necessary. Move vim-plug.vim to `~/.vim/autoload/` to enable. Run :PlugInstall to install plugins on any machine from the web.
